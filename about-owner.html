                    At the helm of "The Wrenchman" is the dedicated son of the original founder, who carries forward his father's legacy with passion and innovation. Growing up in an environment steeped in automotive expertise—his father being an automobile engineer from Chennai who established the shop in 1993—the owner has inherited both the technical skills and the entrepreneurial spirit necessary for success.

                    He is deeply committed to his work, often getting personally involved in services to ensure the highest quality for his customers. Equally important to him is his family life; he believes in a balanced approach, dedicating half of his time to the business and the other half to his family, which includes his father, mother, and younger brother. His leadership has not only sustained but also elevated "The Wrenchman" as a trusted name in the community.
